simple website using spacex rest api


In this project, using SpaceX public API I am trying to make a web page for displaying past and upcoming rocket launches.

Primarily, 
  for making api call Javascript - AJAX feature,
  for making connections between the pages Javascript,
  for designing the pages HTML+CSS,             
                  has been used.
 

-As it is my first javascript experience, I mostly search Javascript and it's features.
