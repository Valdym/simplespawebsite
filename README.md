simple website using spacex rest api


In this project, using SpaceX public API I am trying to make a web page for displaying past and upcoming rocket launches.

Primarily, 
  for making api call Javascript - AJAX feature,
  for making connections between the pages Javascript,
  for designing the pages HTML+CSS,             
  for deploying Netlify
                  has been used.
 
 
-As it is my first javascript experience, I mostly search Javascript and it's features.



What did I learn from this project?
I did not do a web page using API call before, after I did this project I think I gain great experience about JavaScript, it's features, how to do API CALL and lots of front-end tricks.
